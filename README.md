# The evolution of an audio synthesis "language"

The core concepts are defined as function in `asynth.rkt`.
To use this repository, the commit history will walk you through
a gradual development of an interpreter for the language, adding
features to the language incrementally. The language definition
itself is in `lang.rkt`.
